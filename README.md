# java-project
Here are some of my Java projects that I did when studying.

oblig6 was a project where I created an application for keeping track of movies and TV-series using JavaFX.

RoBob was a project where we utilized an existing library to make our own version of a robot, fighting other robots in simulations.

The last project was one with four classes: course, instructor, school and student. We had to implement a number of required methods as seen in the school file.
